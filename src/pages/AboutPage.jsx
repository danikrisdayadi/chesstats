      <h1>About Chesstats</h1>
      <p>
        Chesstats is a platform designed for chess.com users to be able to
        compare their statistics with one another. It is built as a summer
        project by Dani, a Year 4 Undergraduate student studying in National
        University of Singapore (NUS). It is built using ReactJS and Material
        UI, amongst many other libraries used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chesstats was born on a bus ride from the National University of
        Singapore (NUS) canteen to the Hostel I lived in. The initial idea was
        for it to conduct a deep analysis to oneâ€™s game and compare it with
        other players. However, after some digging, the chess.com API was rather
        limited to going deep into game analysis, and hence the project was
        scoped down to only include simple statistics you see currently being
        shown.
